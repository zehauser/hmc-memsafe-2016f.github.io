This is the webpage for *Memory Safety*, a half-course being offered at Harvey
Mudd during the second half of Fall 2016. It is embdedded within CS 189:
Programming Practicum.

[Alex Ozdemir][aozdemir] is leading the course, and is being advised by [Colleen
Lewis][colleen] and [Ben Wiedermann][ben].

# The Motivation

A constant struggle when programming is writing programs that are both safe and
highly performant. Most programming languages end up choosing to give the
programmer more control at the expense of safety, or deny that control at the
expense of performance. [Rust][rust-lang], an up and coming programming
language, aims to provide both control of memory and memory safety through the
use of an elaborate type system. In this course we'll take a close look at
exactly how Rust does this, and in the process we'll think a lot about memory
safety, static analysis, and programming language design.

From a day-to-day perspective, the course will consist mostly of writing code
in Rust in order to shed light on how the language addresses memory safety.
We'll also take turns giving presentations on the questions raised by the
assignments, and how those questions can be resolved.
